This is a repository of scripts used for the analyses within Miranda &amp; Hodges, 2025 ("Linking DNA methylation patterns in pancreatic islets to genetic risk for type-2 diabetes").

DNA hypomethylated regions (HMRs) were processed by the MethPipe software (http://smithlabresearch.org/software/methpipe/) and HMR/.meth/read files are available publicly from the MethBase (legacy) track hub on the UCSC Genome Browser.
